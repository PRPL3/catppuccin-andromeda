# Catppuccin Andromeda

This theme incorporates the [Catpuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) palette specifically the Mocha + Lavender variant while using the [Andromeda](https://github.com/EliverLara/Andromeda) syntax highlighting.

Open to feedback and fixes!

# WIP

Might introduce personal changes such as better color schemes for Rust, C/C++, Zig.
No border option coming soon.
